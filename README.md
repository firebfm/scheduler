# Interview Scheduler

Scheduler lets students book an appointment with a selected interviewer. Appointments can be edited and deleted. This was made in React and tested using Jest for unit and integration tests and Cypress for end-to-end testing. The backend is scheduler-api with a postgres database. This project was only created for learning purposes to develop React skills.
